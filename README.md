## Hi, I'm Christie 👋💻
I'm a software developer with a background in social work and addictions research. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Ruby on Rails, and Python.  My interest in developing a breadth of knowledge in all things Technology led to my involvement with [Rewriting the Code](https://rewritingthecode.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAnNacBhDvARIsABnDa6-Eg-kKyuaH33yxlkwGBb1AHppON_HBnw5bZ1rP_7_XaS8g1Yppky4aAhEKEALw_wcB), various [Women who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/) chapters around the world, as well as supporting the founding of the Women in Engineering group at Clio.
